            <h1>Mélisandre Schofield</h1>
            <p>Mélisandre's forray into web development has been slow-building, through her explorations in interactive narrative/game design and her background in visual arts. Her art work consists of writing that oscillates between literature and media. Through her involvement with Lafin (the Liberal Arts Fictional Institute of Narrative: a fictional collective of artists and researchers), she has designed a series of poetic dream experiments, volunteered as an archivist, and written a few novels. </p>
